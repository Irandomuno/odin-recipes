# odin-recipes

Was hesitant to try out the Odin Project but im glad i finally did.
This was a simple recipe project that made us link pages together, use Unorder/Order lists and images from the web.
Repeating the git commands really helped to remembered them.
Added some vegan recipes that i enjoy eating.
Really enjoyed it, cant wait for more projects.
